 Just like any engineer, I don't really like business schools. I've always wondered why I would pay that much money to get an education, when you can get into the best engineering schools of France for free? Even better, if you get into the most prestigious ones, the state GIVES you money, and you're guaranteed to find work before the end of the curriculum.

Nevertheless, when you intend to run a business, you have to learn how to do it. You could pay for a MBA, and basically what you buy is an address book and a recommendation for important positions in big publicly traded companies. Or you could learn by reading, doing, failing, asking others, redoing, etc.
The latter tends to be the way self-development books represent a successful entrepreneur. It is in the continuity of the romantic image of a "self-made man", who dropped out of college, failed several times, and still made its way to "success". "Success" being mostly money, with as little effort as possible.

This book claims to be precisely what you need to succeed in business, without spending all your savings on a degree. It doesn't pretend to be a complete education in itself, rather an organized introduction to all the concepts involved, with a lot of pointers to bibliographic references, in case you intend to go deeper into a particular subject.

Despite being pretty thick, "The Personal MBA" is not long to read, because the author organized it into big sections, composed of several very small chapters. This "to-the-point" organization makes it easy to read and to skim through. One of my friends borrowed it to me and had the exact same feeling.

That being said, I'm always suspicious when a book tries to teach me something. In my experience, a real teacher will try to focus on your weaknesses, when a self-taught man would focus on what he enjoys. I remember taking a class of oral expression in English. Every week, we had to prepare a subject and talk about it in front of everyone. Sometimes we had to learn by heart famous speeches or excerpts of Shakespeare and recite them in front of the class. At the beginning of the semester, we were all scared and pretty shitty at expressing a thought in another language. At the end of the semester, we would just skip the preparation and improvise all the talk, while having a lot of fun.

You can't really do the same when reading your way to knowledge. For some subjects, it's not really a problem. I don't mind reading about finances or accounting, or even about the legal matters that you'll obviously have to overcome when running your business. In this regard, I found this book quite interesting. I felt like it summarized some of the things I had read on the internet or in other books, and helped me record them in my memory.


Then it starts to dig into more personal subjects: your relation to yourself and to others. To this day, I haven't found any book that helped me in my work or in my personal life with such advices. Neither does this book. All I see when I read these sections is a recitation on common sense and (judeochristian) morality.
