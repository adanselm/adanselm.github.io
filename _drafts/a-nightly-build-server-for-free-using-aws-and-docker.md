One of the last tools that got the open source community really excited lately is docker, a command-line program that makes Linux containers management really easy.

Instead of simulating a full hardware machine that you'd have to install an OS on, containers make use of a specific linux kernel feature to let you run processes in their own private space (isolated from the rest of the filesystem and processes).
