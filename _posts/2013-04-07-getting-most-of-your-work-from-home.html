If you follow the startup community, or tech websites such as <a href="http://gizmodo.com/">gizmodo</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a>, you've probably noticed that one of the recurring subjects of discussion is productivity, and its close relative, sleep hacking.<br /><br />A lot has been written on those matters already, but reading <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-to-work-productively">this last article on how much sleep we really need</a> made me want to look back at how I organized myself. What worked for me might not work for someone else, of course, but I personally find it useful to gather several testimonies before deciding to change something, so I figured my story might be useful to some.<br /><h2>A look back</h2><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qCjUthoeMOs/UMMpqI7dpSI/AAAAAAAAP60/4ujE9Y4fKag/s1600/2-henri-de-toulouse-lautrec-granger.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qCjUthoeMOs/UMMpqI7dpSI/AAAAAAAAP60/4ujE9Y4fKag/s1600/2-henri-de-toulouse-lautrec-granger.jpg" height="320" width="290" /></a>When I started working for my own company about 2 years ago, I had no real organization. I was used to wake up at the same time pretty much every day, because the habits I had when I was only an employee were still there. But that wasn't really conscious, and quickly after moving to a shared flat in Toulouse to work on my project full time, all this residual discipline started to disappear : I went out several times a week, drank a lot, worked a lot with no real schedule and spread my work in all directions without trying to focus on a particular thing.<br /><br />It didn't take much time to realize I would not be able to go on like this for very long.<br /><br />Realizing it is a thing, but being able to change your habits and find what really works is much harder. When insomnia hit me every night for the second time in a few weeks, I thought I'd give change a try.<br /><br />Long story short, here is what worked for me.<br /><h2>Work-life balance</h2><div>The first thing to do is to try to recreate the habits you had when working in an office :</div><div><ul><li>Go out on the weekend and avoid breaking your weekly rhythm by getting drunk on Mondays already</li><li>Take advantage of having no fixed office hours to go buy your groceries when no one else does, this will save you time. In fact, I'm so used to do those kind of tasks out of phase with the rest of the city that I now go completely crazy when I get stuck in the traffic or find myself at the mall in the middle of a sea of people. You should try to plan those tasks all along the week though, preferably in the afternoons when you don't feel that productive anyway.</li><li>Exercise, have hobbies, go out. If you eat 3 pizzas a day, don't go out, and don't exercise, chances are you'll go insane or that your name is Jabba The Hut. For instance, I practice boxing, yoga (+ running from time to time) and of course, music. And if you don't spend enough time with your significant other, you're exposing yourself to trouble as well... everyone needs balance!</li></ul></div><h2>Waking up with the boost</h2>I don't have a very deep sleep so I usually have no problem hearing the alarm clock. And actually most of the time I don't even use an alarm clock and just wake up by myself at the right time as long as I keep the same good&nbsp;rhythm&nbsp;all the time. So my point is: do everything to get into this weekly organization and after a while you won't have to fight to wake up.<br /><ul><li>If you feel like you're going to fall asleep again in the morning, start reading things on your smartphone, like news feeds or twitter, but avoid directly looking at your work emails.</li><li>Act as if you were going to work. As soon as you sit at your desk, it should be like going to the office. Breakfast, reading the news, showering, exercising... all these tasks should happen before sitting at your desk.</li><li>Luminotherapy (using a specific desk light supposedly replacing the natural light of the sun) doesn't work for me. At least, I don't feel any difference after using it every morning for a few weeks.</li><li>On the other hand, happy or energetic music when I start to work really makes a difference for me. Depending on my mood, I'll put on some reggae, metal, hip-hop, electro or anything that'd basically make my head nod.</li><li>Complementary vitamin pills seem to be pretty useful, especially during cold season. But you have to take them every day.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://image-cnes.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Decollage_Ariane5_vol194.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://image-cnes.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Decollage_Ariane5_vol194.jpg" height="282" width="400" /></a></div><h2>Getting up early</h2>The most productive time of the day is the morning. Every one will tell you that, and it's true. Just recently I had to tackle a big bug in the code that's been keeping us two busy for a whole day already. Being stuck for so long on the same problem is quite unusual, and when it happens, you feel like you tried everything to fix it already, and the only ideas that remain usually involve heavy work (like going back in your source control to see when the bug started to appear, or setting up a smaller program to isolate the problem and submit it to a forum). This heavy work requires all your attention and there is no other time you'll have the courage to tackle it than at the beginning of the day.<br /><div><br />Even if you think you're more of an evening person, you're just lying to yourself. And besides, as soon as your work involves calling people and organizing stuff, working nights simply doesn't help. Any day started after 11am is a wasted day, period.<br /><ul></ul><h2>Going to sleep</h2>You will work late. That's a fact. After all, being able to organize yourself as you see fit is one of the good parts of being&nbsp;independent.&nbsp;But you should also pick a time after which work is over and you can relax. Stick to this time or your night will be compromised.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once you've taken the habit to stop working at a given time in the evening, a few things could help you find sleep or optimize it:<br /><ul><li>Don't drink coffee after 2 pm. The hour is arbitrary. Pick yours depending on your own experimentations.</li><li>After lunch naps are great when you feel too sleepy. I'd rather sleep 20-30 min than struggle to focus. But don't oversleep, so use an alarm clock.</li><li>Don't use cannabis thinking it'll help you fall asleep. It won't. Or more precisely, it could work half of the time, and do the exact opposite the other half. And when it works, you'll feel it's twice more difficult to wake up the morning after.</li><li>I have no advice regarding sleeping pills, as I've always refused to take them, even when I had insomnia. So if anyone has an opinion on the subject, I'll be glad to hear it.</li><li>One of the best advice of the article mentioned earlier, is to read a fiction book in your bed before trying to sleep. This really helps at forgetting the day and preparing a good night, and is usually part of a sleep ritual. My sleep ritual also contains drinking herbal tea before going to my room. Sounds gay (no offense!) but it's part of my process.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>That's it for the work-life balance part. Again, it is no rocket science but just personal experimentation that others could reflect to.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next time, I'll focus on productivity and self-organization.</div><h2></h2><div><ul></ul></div></div>
