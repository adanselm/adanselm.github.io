I often say that I've never been happier than when I was studying abroad. I was excited to get up everyday, my days of
work or study were just a little annoyance in the back of my mind, and I didn't care about the future or finding a soul
mate or whatever kids think is the sugar of life these days.<br /><br />Actually now that I think about it, it explains
why I dig traveling so much : my unconscious mind makes me chase those sensations like a drug addict looks for his fix.
But why did I feel this way? Was it because any other country was better than mine? I don't think so. Was it because of
the rush of adrenaline that comes with any adventure? To a certain extent, probably, but it wasn't the
most&nbsp;prominent&nbsp;factor. No, if I'm really honest with myself, this is what my situation was like:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>My material goods were just the clothes and few goods I brought in my luggage.</li>
    <li>The only financial assets I had were a couple hundreds euros from my scholarship and some pocket money, but on
        the other end I had ridiculously small expenses and I had no loan to pay every month, nor did I have taxes to
        pay.</li>
    <li>I left all my family and friends to be in the middle of people who don't know me. Friendship and family are
        important to live a balanced life, of course, but you know how sometimes you feel like your history is following
        you and that no matter what you do, people will judge you for who you were rather than who you are now? Well at
        least when you're starting fresh, you don't have to bother about the past. A few phone calls or mails from time
        to time, that's all close friends and family are asking for. Plus you're more open to others because you need
        their friendship to avoid being alone.</li>
</ul><br />In a word, it was a simple life (and I'm not talking about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362153/"
    target="_blank">the show with Paris Hilton</a>).<br /><br />There are plenty of articles and blog posts about formal
recipes to live a happy life. The last one I read was this one:&nbsp;<a
    href="http://joel.is/post/29704334130/6-things-i-do-to-be-consistently-happy">http://joel.is/post/29704334130/6-things-i-do-to-be-consistently-happy</a>&nbsp;quite
an interesting read which goes along well with what yoga or buddhism say.<br />Now I don't know if they're right or
wrong, and I don't pretend to have the answer to everything, but I noticed that very few speak about the benefits of an
<u>uncluttered life</u>. And when they do, it's often wrapped into some new-age bullcrap (the kind that
says:&nbsp;<i>"happiness is inside us, not in the objects we buy"</i>).<br /><br />Despite being aware of the Zen
practices and the concept of <i>detachment</i>, I realized how important this all was when I first read a practical
guide to life simplification:&nbsp;<a
    href="http://www.amazon.fr/Lart-lessentiel-linutile-superflu-lespace/dp/2290018554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345548245&amp;sr=8-1"
    target="_blank">L'art de l'essentiel: jeter le superflu</a><br />The title is in French but it's really easy to
guess the English meaning: <i>"The art of the essential: throwing away the extraneous"</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>more or less.
What it does is basically take every aspect of a modern life and advise you to consider what can be thrown
away:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>Take a look at your books and only keep those you really like and read often.</li>
    <li>In the kitchen, get rid of all the knives you have and buy just one good polyvalent knife.</li>
    <li>If you think you might need those things later, put them in a box, and chances are you won't open the box a year
        later. Then you can realize that you don't need them.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<div>Of course it's not easy to do. For instance I could probably sell my car or the guitars I only seldom use, but I
    can't. On the other hand I was able to apply this principle to almost every other thing I own, and it really made me
    feel like a weight was taken off my chest.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>You can even go further, and try to apply the same concepts to other domains: the music you compose, or the
    software you design, or basically anything, actually. Deep inside, we all know it is something important, but as
    usual, the difficulty lies in the next step: taking action.&nbsp;</div>
