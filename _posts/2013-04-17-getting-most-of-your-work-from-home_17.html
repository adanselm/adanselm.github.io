<br />Following <a href="{% post_url 2013-04-07-getting-most-of-your-work-from-home %}">last post about my views on
    work-life balance</a>, here is how I organize my work from home.<br />
<h2>Reach the unreachable: Productivity optimization</h2>
<div>Considering my goal in life is to enjoy good things while they last, it won't be surprising to anyone that I intend
    to minimize the time I spend working.<br />To achieve such a noble cause, my organization revolves around 3 main
    tools:&nbsp;<a href="http://trello.com/">trello</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://calendar.google.com/">google
        calendar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fogbugz.com/">fogbugz</a>. Plus a good old notebook (so I guess
    that makes 4 tools ^__^, but anyways...).</div>
<h3>Keeping track</h3>
<div>Before you can get to work, it is probably worth knowing where you're at, and what are the next tasks that need to
    be tackled before they reach your try line, like a sluggish rugby player inexorably walking towards you.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
        href="http://www.parkmorerfc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fatman.jpg" imageanchor="1"
        style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"

<div><br /></div>
<h4>Company running</h4>
<div>We use a Trello board to keep track of everything regarding the company, except for the development. Trello is a
    simple online system for displaying a list of lists. The most basic one being a page with 3 columns: "todo",
    "doing", "done", and cards in each column describing a task, that you can move around all you want and assign to
    users. Think post-its on a black board, except that it's all in your browser.<br />In our system, development tasks
    only have simple cards containing upcoming releases in Trello, the details are being kept in Fogbugz. But Trello can
    also be useful to keep a list of features, or internships, or whatever you need not to forget.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Our main trello board contains the people we have to contact, administrative tasks, future tasks that need to be
    reactivated later but not forgotten, etc. Then the time constraints are put in google calendar to ensure that we
    never forget to send our tax forms in time, or that we can schedule meetings in slots where we are both available.
</div>
<h4>Development</h4>
<div>Our development policy is pretty traditional in the sense that it uses a simple bug/feature tracking system called
    Fogbugz. We keep track of all the features and bugs, define milestones, and sort them by priority in a backlog
    fashion.</div>
<div>All of this is basic but simply works. You should read about the specificities of Fogbugz on <a
        href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogCreek</a> if you wish to know more. We could use pretty much any bug
    tracking tool, but we like Fogbugz because it works well, costs nothing for 2 users, and allows us to track the time
    spent on each task as well, which is very, very important since this information can be checked by the french
    administration anytime (as a component of our complex tax-refund system for companies doing R&amp;D).</div>
<h3>Personal tasks</h3>
<div>So far there's nothing very original in this system, because project management for development has not changed
    that much since the good old days of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythical_man_month">Mythical Man
        Month</a>. Of course, there has been all the hype around agile practices, but in a company of 2 developers, who
    doesn't iterate in a <i>de facto</i> agile way?<br /><br />No, what really is the most difficult part as an
    independent working from home is organizing your own work, day after day. It's especially important when you're
    dealing with a pile of tasks so big that it could keep you busy until you retire. It took me a lot of time to figure
    out a system that works for me.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Usually people get lured by the promises of software or apps that will manage their "todo list" for them. After a
    couple of days trying these out, I found several problems:</div>
<div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
            href="http://cdn-aws.store.moleskine.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/9/7/9788866130901-1800-002.jpg"
            imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0"
                src="http://cdn-aws.store.moleskine.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/9/7/9788866130901-1800-002.jpg"
                height="213" width="320" /></a></div>
    <ul>
        <li>Most items were&nbsp;<i>"big fishes"</i>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<i>"develop feature XYZ"</i>, which were
            impossible to complete in a day, even weeks sometimes!</li>
        <li>It was so easy to postpone items that I didn't really get the feeling of time passing by. Consequently, I
            could not realize when I was late, I just thought&nbsp;<i>"it's a big task, spending several days on it is a
                normal thing"</i>.</li>
        <li>Or sometimes I got the opposite feeling of being overwhelmed, and that I was super bad for not being able to
            complete this single item, when I have a thousand more on the list.</li>
    </ul>This led me to realize that I needed something else than yet another app. Reading the advices of a&nbsp;<a
        href="http://nicolaspene.fr/">french personal coach</a>&nbsp;gave me the idea of the notebook, that
    progressively changed into a weekly planner such as the one pictured above.
</div>
<div>The way I use it is very simple too:</div>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Every week</b>, I gather the various tasks I have to do (from Trello and Fogbugz), either to run the
            company or for product development (but mostly development though), and I prioritize them and write them on
            the blank right-hand side page of the planner. I take good care to rewrite the tasks of the previous week on
            the new page, thus realizing when an item has been hanging around for too long.</li>
        <li><b>Every morning</b>, I write a couple items as a goal for my work. If the item on the right is too big, I
            write down a subtask as my daily goal, trying to estimate in slices no longer than 3-4 hours work.</li>
        <li><b>At the end of the day</b>, I report for the next day the ones I didn't have time to do, or usually, a
            subtask consisting of the exact remaining work.</li>
        <li>I also write down the tasks I didn't plan to do but that imposed themselves, even if they're not work
            related (like&nbsp;<i>"sent forms to social security"</i>). This way, I can look at my day and see that I
            didn't procrastinate.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>Dead simple, but super efficient. Probably because it kinda feels like doing your homework. Maybe because it
    involves writing, feeling the paper and seeing the red notebook on your desk everyday. I don't really
    know.<br /><br /></div>
<div><br />
    <ul></ul>
