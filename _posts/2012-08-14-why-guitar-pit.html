<h3>Why God, why?</h3>I swear it's been a thorough discussion.<br /><br />Discussed with myself, first, as I was feeling
torn apart between the need to share some knowledge with other fellow entrepreneurs and developers, and my previous
experience of blogging. See, I've already had a blog a long time ago (like, 7 years ago) when I was traveling (/working)
in South Korea, and wasn't totally sure I wanted to impose myself the constraints it brings along (mostly writing stuff
on a regular basis, when I already have so many things going on, and bearing the comments that some haters necessarily
have to leave on every blog they visit, like dog shit on the pavement).<br /><br />Then I discussed with the other half
of <a href="http://www.springbeats.com/" target="_blank">Springbeats</a>, Denis, the orientation we should give to our
communication strategy. We agreed on several points:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>We will open a corporate blog soon, to talk about things related to music production and the way we decided to
        ease the work of producers and musicians in <a href="http://try.springbeats.com/" target="_blank">Instinct</a>.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/springbeats.inc" target="_blank">facebook page</a> is for brand
        enforcement: we are promoting any events related to springbeats there, and try to build a community around our
        products.</li>
    <li>Our <a href="http://twitter.com/springbeats" target="_blank">twitter account</a> is used for direct
        communication with our users. It is also a good feed to follow our work. I use it myself to retweet interesting
        links and just share quick thoughts and puns.</li>
    <li>We also have a Google+ page, but we haven't decided how to use it yet, and that's where we disagreed. I wanted
        to use it to showcase what we're doing internally. I felt bad that the people who showed interest in our work
        during the last MusikMesse in Frankfurt would think we lied to them and have nothing under the hood, when in
        reality we are having fun with some stuff, and struggling with others. But his point was that our potential
        customers are not entrepreneurs nor developers, so there is no need to try to link Springbeats with those
        subjects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bad name intended</h3>
<div>"The guitar pit" is a bad play on words around "the tar pit" and "guitar". The former being a concept from the
    classical book in software project management called "The mythical man month" where author F.Brooks says that
    software is like a tar pit, the more you fight it, the deeper you sink...</div>
<div>I must admit I'm not entirely satisfied with that name, because it only represents part of what Springbeats is: a
    software project about music. But it is much more than that: it's about friends who decide to work together on a
    project, it's about sacrificing a comfortable life to build a product, it's about music and science and
    administration and meeting people and getting drunk and meeting more people and many other things... but I'll let
    you discover by yourself while reading this blog.</div>
