<h2>Microsoft did a pretty good job.</h2>I never thought I'd write such a statement one day, but Skydrive actually is a pretty nice (and cheap!) service!<br />For those who wonder, SkyDrive is an equivalent of Dropbox, that is, it synchronizes your data with their servers on the cloud, and lets you access it from anywhere using either their desktop, mobile or web applications.<br />There is no really notable new feature in comparison to Dropbox, they just do the same, but better.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="315" src="/images/onedrive.png" width="640" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">SkyDrive website and its new metro-style interface.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It could become one of Redmond's giant's successes (along with the Xbox, part of Visual Studio, the Metro interface, their keyboards and mice, and other stuff I forgot), honestly.<br />And I'm not endorsed by Microsoft, quite the opposite: I'm a fan of free software. When I was a student, I even took part to the writing of a manifesto so that the public funds would not be wasted in proprietary software. But I also know how to recognize a good initiative, like Bizspark (which supports us) and a good product, like SkyDrive.<br /><br />Why on earth am I mentioning that?<br /><div>Well I first thought I'd talk a bit about how we organise ourselves between the company documents, code, documentation and all, and how it led me to consider using this technology for my personal stuff as well, but that would make this post too long, so I'll just skip to what led me to SkyDrive for my personal data, and deal with the rest in another post.<br /><br /></div><div><h2>Storing large amount of data on the cloud: comparison time</h2></div><div>Once we had something working for our organization at Springbeats (which will be detailed in another post), I wanted to find a way to store my personal data on the cloud. As a backup, but also to be able to show pictures on my phone any time I needed to.<br />Tons of articles were already written about the existing cloud storage solutions. Like <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/24/2954960/google-drive-dropbox-skydrive-sugarsync-cloud-storage-competition" target="_blank">this one</a>, for instance.</div><div>I personally tried several of those solutions:<br /><br /><ul><li>InSync, which provided dropbox-like storage on Google Docs, before Google allowed it by itself,&nbsp;</li><li>Amazon, which seems more fit for photos and music than for any kind of file,&nbsp;</li><li>Zumodrive, which got sold to another company and stopped its service,&nbsp;</li><li>Google Drive again, but upgrade plans always seemed too expensive for my taste.</li></ul></div><div>Then I discovered <a href="http://hubic.me/" target="_blank">HubiC</a>, provided by the french hosting company OVH, which was much cheaper, especially considering they sell an unlimited storage for 70 EUR a year (excl. VAT)! But after a while, I missed a synchronization mechanism and I got fed up with all the bugs and the turtle speed.</div><div>Next one to evaluate among the cheap ones was SkyDrive. Definitely more expensive (37 EUR a year incl. VAT for 100GB, as opposed to 12 EUR a year incl. VAT for the same size at HubiC...), but still much cheaper than Dropbox, Google, iCloud and even plain Amazon S3 storage (without any applicative front-end)!<br /><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><th>Storage size / Price per year(incl.VAT)</th><th>2GB</th><th>7GB</th><th>25GB</th><th>57GB</th><th>100GB</th><th>Unlimited</th></tr><tr><td>HubiC</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Free</td><td>X</td><td>11.84 EUR</td><td>83.60 EUR</td></tr><tr><td>SkyDrive</td><td>X</td><td>Free</td><td>8 EUR (act.27GB)</td><td>19 EUR</td><td>37 EUR (107GB)</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>Free</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>$99</td><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table>Of course it's not all about the price, it also works like a charm. Seems pretty fast as well, but maybe that's because all the users are on holidays this month, I don't know. And it's a big company so there is little chance that it will disappear tomorrow, like it did when I tried Zumodrive (they got bought by another company).<br />So now Microsoft has the privilege to be the provider of my choice to store photos of my cute nieces. Congratulations! ;)&nbsp;</div><div>Plus I recently learned that <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/skydrive/b/skydrive/archive/2012/08/14/a-new-modern-skydrive-com-updated-apps-and-outlook-com-at-10-million-users.aspx" target="_blank">an Android app is coming</a>. I know that some people were waiting for that to happen before they make the move. They won't have any more excuse now.<br /><br /><h2>Now what?</h2></div><div>Now I'm waiting for an unlimited storage plan in SkyDrive. Like what HubiC is proposing.</div><div>It would also be good to know more precisely how the data is accessed, once put on the cloud. Microsoft claims they don't scan the data. But will it stay like that? I don't mind if a picture of me getting drunk in <i>-put your favorite country here-</i> is seen by anyone. But on a professional level, it's a bit scary: what if Microsoft decides to enter the same business as us? They would already have all our docs!<br />The best way to prove their good faith, in my opinion,&nbsp;would be to open-source their client and give the option to store encrypted data. Because let's be honest, the added value of such services is not really in the clients, it's in the quality of the cloud for the price, and in the way it is integrated with other applications.</div>
