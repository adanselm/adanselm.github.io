As a backer of the kickstarter campaign to fund <a href="http://www.revolution.co.uk/games/bs5/">Broken Sword 5 "The Serpent's curse"</a>, I got to download and play the last episode of the epic saga that got me glued to my computer chair back in the days.<br /><br />The story takes place a few years after the previous episodes. Georges stumbles upon his good friend (and ex-lover) Nico while he's at the inauguration of a parisian art gallery his company insured. Of course, as you might guess, the event doesn't go as smoothly as it should, as the gallery owner is shot during the ceremony by a pizza delivery man impersonator. The man steals a painting, which is obviously not worth that much money, so everyone wonders why he picked this one. A priest who attended the inauguration, tells us that this painting is religious and was made by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">gnostics</a>, and that it brings death to those who approach it, which you'll soon start to believe as well...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/images/george-and-nico.jpg" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Now I must say I'm a fan of the broken sword saga and adventure games in general. I bought the first two episodes, whose original boxes should still be around somewhere at my parents' house. Then I bought the remastered versions on iPhone, and I enjoyed playing with them again. I was surprised how much I had forgotten in all those years.<br /><br />Then as a backer for Broken Sword 5, I was able to download Broken Sword 3 and 4. I got bored while playing the third opus, and hated the 3D, like everyone who got to play it I guess. And I didn't even touch the fourth, because I wasn't able to make it work through Crossover, which I used to play the third game on my mac. But since it's in 3D as well, I don't think I missed much.<br /><br />Now back to this episode... No need to keep the suspense, I'm a bit disappointed!<br />I love how they got back to hand-made 2D backgrounds and used pretty 3D characters (that look a lot like those in another adventure game whose name I forgot). Their animation is sometimes pretty stiff, but I forgot about it fairly quickly. I also appreciated the historical roots behind the story much more than when I was a kid. The gnostics against the dominicans, the cathars, etc. Especially since the cathars were in the south west of France, where I live :)<br /><br />The dialogs and voices are still good, and rather funny at times, but the puzzles are either too easy (especially compared to "<a href="http://machinarium.net/">Machinarium</a>"), or too illogical: I sometimes had to try all of my inventory for the possible interactions with the environment to get out of situations where an obvious solution that I had in mind didn't work.<br /><br />But the most disappointing thing is its lifetime. I took me 7 hours to complete. I know, Charles Cecil decided to split this episode into two parts, to be able to release the first half before christmas, so this means it is only half of the game. If the whole games takes 14 hours to complete, that would make it an honorable duration. But added to the fact that the whole game has a strange sluggish feel, induced by the delay between two dialogs (which I ended up reading quickly and skipping by a click on the mouse almost every time) and the slow movements of the characters, I can't help but feel like I got my hands on an incomplete game.<br /><br />In the past year, I had more fun playing "<a href="http://thecavegame.com/">The Cave</a>" and being carried away by "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game)">The walking dead</a>" than I had playing this game. I really hope the next episode will make it up to the level of the competition...
